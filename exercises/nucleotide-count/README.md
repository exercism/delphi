# Nucleotide Count

Given a single stranded DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

The genetic language of every living thing on the planet is DNA. 
DNA is a large molecule that is built from an extremely long sequence of individual elements called nucleotides. 
4 types exist in DNA and these differ only slightly and can be represented as the following symbols: 'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' thymine.

Here is an analogy:
- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA as
- legos are to lego houses as
- words are to sentences as...

In RNA the thymine is substituted with 'U' for uracil, while the remainder stay the same; A, U, C, G.

## Testing

In order to run the tests for this track, you will need to install
DUnitX. Please see the [installation](http://www.exercism.io/languages/delphi/installing) instructions for more information.

### Loading Exercises into Delphi

If Delphi is properly installed, and `*.dpr` file types have been associated with Delphi, then double clicking the supplied `*.dpr` file will start Delphi and load the exercise/project.  `control + F9` is the keyboard shortcut to compile the project or pressing `F9` will compile and run the project.

Alternatively you may opt to start Delphi and load your project via. the `File` drop down menu.

### When Questions Come Up
We monitor the [Pascal-Delphi](https://gitter.im/exercism/Pascal-Delphi) support room on [gitter.im](https://gitter.im) to help you with any questions that might arise.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/delphi/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `ubob.pas` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/delphi/bob/ubob.pas`.
