# OCR Numbers

Given a 3 x 4 grid of pipes, underscores, and spaces, determine which number is
represented, or whether it is garbled.

# Step One

To begin with, convert a simple binary font to a string containing 0 or 1.

The binary font uses pipes and underscores, four rows high and three columns wide.

```text
     _   #
    | |  # zero.
    |_|  #
         # the fourth row is always blank
```

Is converted to "0"

```text
         #
      |  # one.
      |  #
         # (blank fourth row)
```

Is converted to "1"

If the input is the correct size, but not recognizable, your program should return '?'

If the input is the incorrect size, your program should return an error.

# Step Two

Update your program to recognize multi-character binary strings, replacing garbled numbers with ?

# Step Three

Update your program to recognize all numbers 0 through 9, both individually and as part of a larger string.

```text
 _ 
 _|
|_ 
   
```

Is converted to "2"

```text
      _  _     _  _  _  _  _  _  #
    | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|| | # decimal numbers.
    ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _||_| #
                                 # fourth line is always blank
```

Is converted to "1234567890"

# Step Four

Update your program to handle multiple numbers, one per line. When converting several lines, join the lines with commas.

```text
    _  _ 
  | _| _|
  ||_  _|
         
    _  _ 
|_||_ |_ 
  | _||_|
         
 _  _  _ 
  ||_||_|
  ||_| _|
         
```

Is converted to "123,456,789"

## Testing

In order to run the tests for this track, you will need to install
DUnitX. Please see the [installation](http://www.exercism.io/languages/delphi/installation) instructions for more information.

### Loading Exercises into Delphi

If Delphi is properly installed, and `*.dpr` file types have been associated with Delphi, then double clicking the supplied `*.dpr` file will start Delphi and load the exercise/project.  `control + F9` is the keyboard shortcut to compile the project or pressing `F9` will compile and run the project.

Alternatively you may opt to start Delphi and load your project via. the `File` drop down menu.

### When Questions Come Up
We monitor the [Pascal-Delphi](https://gitter.im/exercism/Pascal-Delphi) support room on [gitter.im](https://gitter.im) to help you with any questions that might arise.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/delphi/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `ubob.pas` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/delphi/bob/ubob.pas`.
