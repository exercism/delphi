# Scrabble Score

Given a word, compute the scrabble score for that word.

## Letter Values

You'll need these:

```text
Letter                           Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10
```

## Examples

"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

- `3 + 2*1 + 2*3 + 2 + 1`
- = `3 + 2 + 6 + 3`
- = `5 + 9`
- = 14

## Testing

In order to run the tests for this track, you will need to install
DUnitX. Please see the [installation](http://www.exercism.io/languages/delphi/installation) instructions for more information.

### Loading Exercises into Delphi

If Delphi is properly installed, and `*.dpr` file types have been associated with Delphi, then double clicking the supplied `*.dpr` file will start Delphi and load the exercise/project.  `control + F9` is the keyboard shortcut to compile the project or pressing `F9` will compile and run the project.

Alternatively you may opt to start Delphi and load your project via. the `File` drop down menu.

### When Questions Come Up
We monitor the [Pascal-Delphi](https://gitter.im/exercism/Pascal-Delphi) support room on [gitter.im](https://gitter.im) to help you with any questions that might arise.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/delphi/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `ubob.pas` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/delphi/bob/ubob.pas`.
