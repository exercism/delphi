# Markdown

Refactor a Markdown parser.

The markdown exercise is a refactoring exercise. There is code that parses a
given string with [Markdown
syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and returns the
associated HTML for that string. Even though this code is confusingly written
and hard to follow, somehow it works and all the tests are passing! Your
challenge is to re-write this code to make it easier to read and maintain
while still making sure that all the tests keep passing.

It would be helpful if you made notes of what you did in your refactoring in
comments so reviewers can see that, but it isn't strictly necessary. The most
important thing is to make the code better!

## Testing

In order to run the tests for this track, you will need to install
DUnitX. Please see the [installation](http://www.exercism.io/languages/delphi/installation) instructions for more information.

### Loading Exercises into Delphi

If Delphi is properly installed, and `*.dpr` file types have been associated with Delphi, then double clicking the supplied `*.dpr` file will start Delphi and load the exercise/project.  `control + F9` is the keyboard shortcut to compile the project or pressing `F9` will compile and run the project.

Alternatively you may opt to start Delphi and load your project via. the `File` drop down menu.

### When Questions Come Up
We monitor the [Pascal-Delphi](https://gitter.im/exercism/Pascal-Delphi) support room on [gitter.im](https://gitter.im) to help you with any questions that might arise.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/delphi/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `ubob.pas` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/delphi/bob/ubob.pas`.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you may request help from a mentor.
