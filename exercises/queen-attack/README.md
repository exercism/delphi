# Queen Attack

Given the position of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they
are positioned so that they can attack each other.

In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same
row, column, or diagonal.

A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.

So if you're told the white queen is at (2, 3) and the black queen at
(5, 6), then you'd know you've got a set-up like so:

```text
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ W _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ B _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
```

You'd also be able to answer whether the queens can attack each other.
In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces
share a diagonal.

## Testing

In order to run the tests for this track, you will need to install
DUnitX. Please see the [installation](http://www.exercism.io/languages/delphi/installation) instructions for more information.

### Loading Exercises into Delphi

If Delphi is properly installed, and `*.dpr` file types have been associated with Delphi, then double clicking the supplied `*.dpr` file will start Delphi and load the exercise/project.  `control + F9` is the keyboard shortcut to compile the project or pressing `F9` will compile and run the project.

Alternatively you may opt to start Delphi and load your project via. the `File` drop down menu.

### When Questions Come Up
We monitor the [Pascal-Delphi](https://gitter.im/exercism/Pascal-Delphi) support room on [gitter.im](https://gitter.im) to help you with any questions that might arise.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/delphi/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `ubob.pas` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/delphi/bob/ubob.pas`.
