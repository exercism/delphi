# Binary Search Tree

Insert and search for numbers in a binary tree.

When we need to represent sorted data, an array does not make a good
data structure.

Say we have the array `[1, 3, 4, 5]`, and we add 2 to it so it becomes
`[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]` now we must sort the entire array again! We can
improve on this by realizing that we only need to make space for the new
item `[1, nil, 3, 4, 5]`, and then adding the item in the space we
added. But this still requires us to shift many elements down by one.

Binary Search Trees, however, can operate on sorted data much more
efficiently.

A binary search tree consists of a series of connected nodes. Each node
contains a piece of data (e.g. the number 3), a variable named `left`,
and a variable named `right`. The `left` and `right` variables point at
`nil`, or other nodes. Since these other nodes in turn have other nodes
beneath them, we say that the left and right variables are pointing at
subtrees. All data in the left subtree is less than or equal to the
current node's data, and all data in the right subtree is greater than
the current node's data.

For example, if we had a node containing the data 4, and we added the
data 2, our tree would look like this:

      4
     /
    2

If we then added 6, it would look like this:

      4
     / \
    2   6

If we then added 3, it would look like this

       4
     /   \
    2     6
     \
      3

And if we then added 1, 5, and 7, it would look like this

          4
        /   \
       /     \
      2       6
     / \     / \
    1   3   5   7

## Testing

In order to run the tests for this track, you will need to install
DUnitX. Please see the [installation](http://www.exercism.io/languages/delphi/installation) instructions for more information.

### Loading Exercises into Delphi

If Delphi is properly installed, and `*.dpr` file types have been associated with Delphi, then double clicking the supplied `*.dpr` file will start Delphi and load the exercise/project.  `control + F9` is the keyboard shortcut to compile the project or pressing `F9` will compile and run the project.

Alternatively you may opt to start Delphi and load your project via. the `File` drop down menu.

### When Questions Come Up
We monitor the [Pascal-Delphi](https://gitter.im/exercism/Pascal-Delphi) support room on [gitter.im](https://gitter.im) to help you with any questions that might arise.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/delphi/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `ubob.pas` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/delphi/bob/ubob.pas`.
