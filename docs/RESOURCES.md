## Recommended Learning Resources

The [Delphi Basics](http://www.delphibasics.co.uk/) is a good reference on Delphi.

I also recommend reading [delphi.about.com](http://delphi.about.com/)'s "[A Beginner's Guide to Delphi Programming](http://delphi.about.com/od/beginners/a/delphicourse.htm)", which is a nice primer to Delphi programming.
