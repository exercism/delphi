**Embarcadero Delphi** is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) and [software development kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit) (SDK) for [desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), [mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app), [web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application), and [console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_application) applications.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)#cite_note-Buchanan2003-1) Delphi's compilers use their own [Object Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal) dialect of [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) and generate native code for several platforms: Windows ([x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA-32) and [x64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64)), [OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) (32-bit only), [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) (32 and 64-bit), [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), and 64 bit [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux).

Delphi was originally developed by [Borland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland) as a [rapid application development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development) tool for Windows as the successor of [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal). Delphi added full object-orientation to the existing language, and since then the language has grown and supports many other modern language features, including generics and anonymous methods, as well as unusual features such as inbuilt string types and native COM support.

In 2006, Borlandâ€™s developer tools section were transferred from Borland to a wholly owned subsidiary known as [CodeGear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeGear), which was sold to [Embarcadero Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Technologies) in 2008. In 2015, Embarcadero was purchased by Idera, but the Embarcadero mark was retained for the developer tools division.
