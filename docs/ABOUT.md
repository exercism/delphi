## Delphi (programming language) ##
*From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia*

**Embarcadero Delphi** is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) and [software development kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit) (SDK) for [desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), [mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app), [web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application), and [console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_application) applications.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)#cite_note-Buchanan2003-1) Delphi's compilers use their own [Object Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal) dialect of [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) and generate native code for several platforms: Windows ([x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA-32) and [x64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64)), [OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) (32-bit only), [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) (32 and 64-bit) and [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)).

Delphi, part of [RAD Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)#RAD_Studio), includes a code editor with [Code Insight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Insight) ([code completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete#In_source_code_editors)), [Error Insight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_Insight) (real-time error-checking), and other features; [refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring); a visual forms designer for both [VCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library) (native Windows) and [FMX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireMonkey) (cross-platform, partially native per platform); an integrated debugger for all platforms including mobile; source control ([SVN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion), [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), and [Mercurial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial)); and support for third-party plugins. It has strong database support. Delphi is remarkably fast to compile:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)#cite_note-2) unlike any other common languages, including C# and Swift, it is not unusual for a Delphi project of a million lines to compile in a few seconds – one benchmark gave 170,000 lines per second.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)#cite_note-4) It is under active development, with (in 2016) releases every six months, with new platforms being added approximately every second release.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)#cite_note-5)

Delphi was originally developed by [Borland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland) as a [rapid application development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development) tool for Windows as the successor of [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal). Delphi added full object-orientation to the existing language, and since then the language has grown and supports many other modern language features, including generics and anonymous methods, as well as unusual features such as inbuilt string types and native COM support. Delphi and its [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) counterpart, [C++ Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2BBuilder), share many core components, notably the IDE, the [Visual Component Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library) (VCL), and much of the [RTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_library), and are compatible with each other: C++ Builder 6 and onwards can consume Delphi-language files and C++ in the one project, and packages compiled with C++ Builder written in C++ can be used from within Delphi. In 2007, the products were released jointly as RAD Studio. [RAD Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)#RAD_Studio) is a shared host for Delphi and C++Builder, and can be purchased with either or both.

In 2006, Borland’s developer tools section were transferred from Borland to a wholly owned subsidiary known as [CodeGear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeGear), which was sold to [Embarcadero Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Technologies) in 2008. In 2015, Embarcadero was purchased by Idera, but the Embarcadero mark was retained for the developer tools division.
