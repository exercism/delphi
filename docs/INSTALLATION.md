# Installing Delphi and DUnitX Testing Framework #
### Windows ###

30 day free trial of Embarcadero's RAD Studio or Delphi may be downloaded from [here](https://www.embarcadero.com/products?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand&utm_content=brand&utm_embarcadero&gclid=CjwKEAiAp97CBRDr2Oyl-faxqRMSJABx4kh9V8bOEuG0CznQ9AGToIyuKeTzvevljmHTboYXk4n6OxoC4Frw_wcB).  Follow installation instructions included with the product.

### Non-Windows based Operating Systems ###

Sorry, Delphi does not run natively on any other operating systems.  However it should be possible to install Delphi into a virtual machine which is running Windows.


### Installing DUnitX Test Framework ###
With Delphi successfully installed and working correctly please follow these steps for retrieving and installing DUnitX.

- DUnitX is an open source project by [VSoftTechnologies](https://www.github.com/VSoftTechnologies).  The DUnitX github repo is available [here](https://github.com/VSoftTechnologies/DUnitX).
- It is best to fork the repo and then clone or otherwise download the fork to your local machine.
- Step-by-step instructions on how to install DUnitX into Delphi have been posted by Vincent Parrett in a blog post located [here](https://www.finalbuilder.com/resources/blogs/postid/702/dunitx-has-a-wizard).

*Note: It is assumed that Delphi versions XE and higher are being utilized by the student.*
